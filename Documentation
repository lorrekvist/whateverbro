Made super basic login system. It worked. Refactored code to allow same login method to work for both admin and regular users.

Will remake with simple DB later.

Tested login with incorrect information. Works as intended.

Created register method that adds to the arraylist of reg-users.
Tested to create and login, works as intended.

Reworked login to use way less code, combining checks.
